# huriSafe
HuriSafe is a one stop shop web app that allows users to look at weather patterns, then select an area on the map where there is 
good weather. Rental properties which are available to rent will then populate, and the user can select a property that interests them. They will then be forwarded to the propertys listing page where they can book said property.  IThe aim of this project is to aid in quickly making plans to escape hurricanes or others bad weather patterns before they hit.

Simply click on the map where you would like to find a vacation property, 
Scroll to down to the Properties and select on a property that you find interesting.
